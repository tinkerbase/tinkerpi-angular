UPDATE
---

--- The edit button in the list routes to /edit (no param).  That should have the id of the person in the list.

GraphQL:
{
  mstPeopleUpdate {
    personCode
    firstName
    lastName
    phoneNumber
  }
}
--- The delete button will delete from the list, but it also needs to delete from the database.

* /admin-panel/master/people/edit/xxx     : edit a person

--- This is currently pulling up a blank form.  It should be populated with the First/Last Name from the API call (I'll add more fields later)
--- The links in the left panel will be used in the next phase


* /admin-panel/master/people/view/xxx     : view a person
* /admin-panel/master/people/add          : add a person
